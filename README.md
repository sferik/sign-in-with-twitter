## Usage
Sign in with Twitter requires you to [register an app with Twitter][apps] to
obtain OAuth credentials. Once you obtain credentials, substitute your consumer
key and secret into the command below.

Sign in with twitter requires a callback url, otherwise you will see a "401
Unauthorized" error. The callback url can be any url, except localhost.

## Supported Ruby Version
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] Ruby version 2.2.2.

If something doesn't work on this version, it should be considered a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the version above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
